# A3FL Twitter Scraper

This tool was designed as a practice project but ended up being used within the ArmA 3 Fishers Life community. This tool will repeatedly check for any text containing a phone number from the ArmA 3 Fishers Life in-game Twitter API and once found, will add the phone number and associated name to a Google Sheet. This tool was used to develop a 'phonebook' of sorts.

For metrics, this tool was being hosted by me from the 24th of June 2020, to the 28th of December 2020, which means this script ran roughly 26,928 times in its lifetime.
